Core Goals

Personal Value: Track income, expenses, savings, debts, rainy day money, spontaneous stash maybe, investments if you have them

Professional Value: Build a full-stack, production-quality system (auth, APIs, DB design, UI/UX, deployment).

🛠 Recommended Tech Stack (Windows, free, scalable)

Frontend: Angular (you already know this)

Backend: Java (Spring boot, spring.io)

Database: MySQL (relational, great for structured finance data)

Auth: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2 (for security best practices)

Charts/Visualization: Chart.js or D3.js (to show expenses, income trends)

Deployment: Docker (so it’s portable), later deploy to AWS free tier or Render/Heroku for free hosting

📊 Features to Implement (Step-by-Step)
Phase 1 — MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

User Registration/Login (JWT auth)

Add income & expenses (amount, category, date, description)

View monthly breakdown (summary of income vs expenses)

Categories (food, rent, utilities, entertainment, etc.)

Simple dashboard with charts

Phase 2 — Advanced

Budgeting (set monthly category limits, e.g., $500 groceries)

Alerts/Notifications (if over budget)

Recurring expenses (subscriptions, rent, etc.)

Reports export (CSV, PDF)

Phase 3 — Senior-Level / Portfolio-Worthy

Multi-user support (family accounts, shared dashboard for you + wife)

Bank API integration (Plaid, Yodlee — optional later)

AI insights (predictive analysis, e.g., “you’ll overspend by $200 this month”)

Role-based access (admin vs user)

Secure deployment (HTTPS, Dockerized, CI/CD pipeline)

🚀 Development Roadmap

Backend (Java + MySQL)

Setup Java backend project

Connect to MySQL

Implement REST APIs: /auth, /transactions, /budgets, /reports

Frontend (Angular)

Auth pages (login/register)

Dashboard with charts

Transaction forms (add/edit)

Budget management

Integration

Secure API calls with JWT

Display dynamic charts with Chart.js

Deployment

Dockerize both Angular + NestJS apps

Run MySQL in Docker too

Deploy on Render/Heroku/AWS Free Tier

💡 If you build both projects (company internal comms + personal finance app), you’ll:

Prove enterprise-level architecture skills (internal comms tool)

Show real-world product development skills (finance app)

That’s exactly how you transition to senior engineer 🚀.
